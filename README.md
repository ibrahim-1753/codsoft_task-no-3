The above code is a simple To-Do List application. We used a library called Tkinter, which is used to create a GUI. In the application, we can write down a task and either add it by clicking the "Add Task" button or remove it by clicking the "Remove Task" button. If the input box is empty and we click on the "Add Task" or "Remove Task" button, we will be met with a warning that says, "Task cannot be empty."
